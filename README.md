# 🏢 Designing Meaningful User Engagement Badges 
A mid-sized online community platform has rolled out a feature for users to post, reply to threads, give away items, recommend places, and organize local events. 
To increase retention and recognize positive participation, the product team is exploring a badge system that rewards consistent, meaningful activity (e.g. "Top Contributor", "Helpful Neighbor", "Event Organizer"). However, they want the badge logic to be:

- Fair (not just rewarding outliers)
- Balanced (not so easy that it loses value)
- Data-informed (based on actual user behavior)

They’ve asked the data team to analyze 20,000 users’ engagement behavior — captured as weekly averages over the past 4, 6, 8, and 12 weeks — and recommend:

Which timeframe best reflects stable user behavior (Z)

Which engagement metrics are best suited for badges 

What thresholds to use to assign those badges meaningfully

This project is aims to analyze user engagement data and propose meaningful badge assignment rules based on behavioral metrics.

## 📌 Objectives

- Understand user behavior over different timeframes (4, 6, 8, 12 weeks)
- Identify stable and differentiating engagement metrics
- Recommend fair, data-driven badge thresholds
